# TLC Trip Record Data

In this assignment, we use AWS Glue, AWS Athena, and AWS QuickSight to analyze the TLC Trip Record Data. The data is from [TLC Trip Record Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/). The data is stored in S3 bucket `s3://nyc-tlc/`. The data is partitioned by year and month. The data is in Parquet format. 

We use all historical data from 2019 to 2023 for rider-sharing companies to analyze the data.
